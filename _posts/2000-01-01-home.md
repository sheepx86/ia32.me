Jian Yang currently works at Google.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at University of California, San Diego, My PhD advisor is Prof. [Steven Swanson](https://swanson.ucsd.edu/).

My research at UCSD was mainly focused on emerging persistent memory and high-performance networking.

I received B.E. in Software Engineering at Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

### Interests

I am interested in networking (TCP/IP and RDMA), storage systems (persistent memory), operating systems and distributed systems.
