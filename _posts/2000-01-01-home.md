I am a Ph.D. student  in Computer Science at University of California, San Diego, advised by Prof. Steven Swanson. My research is mainly focused on the intersection of emerging persistent memory and high-performance networking.

I obtained B.E. in Software Engineering at Fudan University, Shanghai, China.


### Interests

I am interested in the emerging non-volatile memory and other storage systems, RDMA networking, operating systems and distributed systems.
