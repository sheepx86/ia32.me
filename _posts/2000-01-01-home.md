I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of California, San Diego, advised by Prof. Steven Swanson.

My research at UCSD was mainly focused on the intersection of emerging persistent memory and high-performance networking.

I obtained B.E. in Software Engineering at Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

I am currently working at Google.

### Interests

I am interested in the emerging non-volatile memory and other storage systems, RDMA networking, operating systems and distributed systems.
